# Nicad3-emfatic
Nicad3 + extension for clone detection in Emfatic models. (Capita Selecta course assignment)


Nicad is a code clone detection tool, please find more information on http://www.txl.ca/nicaddownload.html.

The purpose of this tool is to find clones in Ecore models. Nicad3 cannot detect graphical model structure, so we use Emfatic, a textual representation of Ecore models, as input of Nicad3. Then use this extension to detection clones in Emfatic.


How to use:

1. generate Emfatic representation of Ecore models in Eclipse.
2. install this extension to analyse the Emfatic files. (The installatiaon of the extension is the same as Nicad3)
3. run the extension to get results. (see details in README.txt and examples in Nicad-3.5 folder)
